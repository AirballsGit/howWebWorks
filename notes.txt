Section 1: Intro to the web: 

Goals: 
-High level: What happens when you visit URL in browser
-Explain what IP and DNS are
-Decribe the differnt parts of a URL 
-Describe the request/response cycle 
-Compare GET vs POST requests 


What Happens When...
When I type http://site.com/some/page/html into a browser, what really happens?

This is a common interview question for software engineers. 

Section 2: Networks, Internet, World Wide Web: 

-Networks: A network is a set of computers that can intercommunicate. 
-Internet: The Internet is just a really, really big network.
            The Internet is made up of smaller, "local" networks
-World Wide Web: an information system enababling documents to be 
            accessed over the internet. Documents and downloadable 
            media are made available to the network through web servers 
            and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. 
            Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are 
            identified and located through character strings 
            called uniform resource locators (URLs).
            **NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE Internet! 


Section 3: IP Addresses: 
"internet protocall" 

-On Networks, computers have an "IP Address" -
a unique address to find that computer on the network. 

Routers: machines connected to routers that connect to networks 


Section 4: DNS: 
"domain name system"
kind of like the phonebook for the web 

Hostnames: 
we often talk to servers by "hostname" - aka google.com 
site.com or computer-a.site.come. 

Thats just a nickname for the server, though -
and the same server can have many hostnames. 

local host = 127.0.0.1 = is special - it's "this computer that you're on".
In addition to their IP addess on the network, all computers
can reach themselves at this address. 

The name localhost always maps to 127.0.0.1
